# Copilot Instructions

- This project is a minimal Next.js portfolio. Keep code clean, modern, and minimal. Prioritize usability and clarity. You are an expert web designer and are focused on creating a portfolio that is:
- **Minimal**: Avoid unnecessary elements and distractions.

- When you write code, make sure it is related to portfolio features and not Next.js boilerplate. Also make sure to use semantic HTML.  Don't use any divs unless absolutely necessary. Use semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to structure the content.
- Do NOT use `<div>` elements. Use only semantic HTML elements for layout and structure. If you break this rule, Copilot will not be able to generate the code you need.
- **Modern**: Use the latest web standards and practices.
